# SAMS Test Suite - Coverage Improvement Summary

## Overview

We've created comprehensive tests to improve coverage for the SAMS system, focusing on the areas with lower coverage:

1. **Forms Coverage**: Added tests for `DeduplicationMixin` and `StudentUpdateForm.save()`
2. **Widgets Coverage**: Added tests for all custom widgets
3. **Views Coverage**: Added extended tests for views using forms and widgets

## New Test Files Created

### 1. `test_widgets.py`
- Tests for `CustomCheckboxSelectMultiple` widget
- Tests for `CustomRadioSelect` widget
- Tests for `StyledSelect` widget
- Tests for `SearchableSelect` widget
- Tests for `StyledTextInput` widget
- Tests for `StyledEmailInput` widget
- Tests for `StyledNumberInput` widget
- Tests for `StyledTextarea` widget
- Integration tests for widgets in forms

### 2. `test_views_extended.py`
- Tests for `StudentUpdateForm` in view context
- Tests for `DeduplicationMixin` in view context
- Tests for `BootstrapFormMixin` in view context
- Tests for custom widgets in view context

### 3. Updated `test_forms.py`
- Added `DeduplicationMixinTest` class
- Added `BootstrapFormMixinTest` class
- Enhanced `StudentUpdateFormTest` with tests for save method
- Added tests for form widget usage

## Coverage Improvements

### Forms Coverage (`sams/forms.py`)
- **Before**: 92% coverage (missing lines 10-12, 154-162)
- **After**: Expected 100% coverage
- **Improvements**:
  - Added tests for `DeduplicationMixin.save()` method
  - Added tests for `StudentUpdateForm.save()` method with and without existing profile
  - Added tests for `BootstrapFormMixin.__init__()` method

### Widgets Coverage (`sams/widgets.py`)
- **Before**: 57% coverage
- **After**: Expected 90%+ coverage
- **Improvements**:
  - Added tests for all widget classes
  - Added tests for widget rendering
  - Added tests for widget attribute handling
  - Added integration tests with forms

### Views Coverage (`sams/views.py`)
- **Before**: 81% coverage
- **After**: Expected 90%+ coverage
- **Improvements**:
  - Added tests for form handling in views
  - Added tests for error handling in views
  - Added tests for widget rendering in views

## Key Test Cases Added

### DeduplicationMixin Tests
- Test successful save operation
- Test handling of IntegrityError
- Test integration with views

### StudentUpdateForm Tests
- Test initialization with existing profile
- Test save method with existing profile
- Test save method without existing profile
- Test integration with views

### Widget Tests
- Test default attributes
- Test custom attributes
- Test rendering output
- Test widget behavior in forms
- Test widget behavior in views

## Expected Coverage Results

After running these tests, we expect:
- **Forms**: 100% coverage
- **Widgets**: 90%+ coverage
- **Views**: 90%+ coverage
- **Overall**: 90%+ coverage

## Running the Tests

To run the new tests:

```bash
# Run widget tests
python manage.py test test_widgets

# Run extended view tests
python manage.py test test_views_extended

# Run form tests
python manage.py test test_forms

# Run all tests
python manage.py test
```

## Next Steps

1. Run the tests and verify coverage improvement
2. Address any remaining coverage gaps
3. Consider adding tests for edge cases in views
4. Integrate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline

These comprehensive tests should significantly improve the test coverage of the SAMS system, ensuring better reliability and maintainability.
